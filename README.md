<h3>Repositories to be used: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Project 1 - Agile & Scrum</li>
  <li>Project 2 - API Development</li>
  <li>Project 3 - Standards & Patterns</li>
  <li>Project 4 - Testing & RPA</li>
  <li>Project 5 - Reporting & Monitoring</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Use of .gitignore</h3>
 <p>When.gitignore is used it essentially tells Git whether there are files that should be ignored when committing a project to your repository.</p>
 
 <h3>Storage of credentials and sensitive information</h3>
 <p>This type of information should never be stored in git repositories. We should rather add these sensitive files to gitignore thus excluding these files from being pushed into the repositories. Furthermore, simply creating a private repository will not be enough as these type of repositories are seen as "High value" targets in which others may gain some valuable information.</p>
 
<h4>Methods to protect sensitive information:</h4>
<h6>(Simon Maple, 2018)</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Addition of SECURITY.md file</li>
  <li>Access control</li>
  <li>Do not always trust third-party GitHub applications</li>
  <li>Consider puurchasing GitHub Enterprise</li>
  <li>Audit sensitive data before committing to repositories</li>
 </ul>
